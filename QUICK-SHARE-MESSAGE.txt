Hi! I built a new web app - "Leadership Communication Mastery" for startup founders. Would love your quick feedback on design/UX.

🔗 Check it out: http://localhost:3000

What to test:
- Sidebar navigation (try mobile menu)
- Case studies section  
- All 5 lesson pages
- Mobile responsiveness

Any thoughts on improvements? Thanks!
