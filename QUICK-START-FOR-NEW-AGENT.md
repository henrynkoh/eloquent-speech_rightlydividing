I'm continuing work on a Next.js project called "Eloquent Speech - Rightly Dividing the Words of Truth". 

**Project Location**: `/Users/henryoh/Documents/eloquent speech_rightlydividing/eloquent-speech`

**GitHub Repository**: `henrynkoh/eloquent-speech_rightlydividing` (SSH)

**Current Status**: The project has a comprehensive appendix page (`app/appendix/page.tsx`) with 13 major sections covering biblical concepts about "rightly dividing the words of truth." I want to continue adding more sections to this appendix.

**IMPORTANT FILES TO READ FIRST**:
1. `AGENT-CONTINUATION-SCRIPT.md` - Complete project documentation and continuation guide
2. `APPENDIX-SECTIONS-INDEX.md` - Index of all current sections
3. `app/appendix/page.tsx` - The main appendix file (read to understand structure)

**WHAT I NEED**:
I want to add new sections to the appendix. Each new section should:
- Follow the exact same structure and styling as existing sections
- Include 30+ KJV Bible verses (more is better)
- Be eloquent, persuasive, and logical
- Include an "Application to Communication" subsection at the end
- Update the Conclusion section to include the new concept

**DESIGN REQUIREMENTS**:
- Use gradient colors: `from-indigo-600 to-pink-600` for main headings
- Use color-coded boxes: blue for foundational, red for warnings, green for positive, amber for applications
- Verse boxes: `bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg` with verse text and citation
- Section structure: Introduction → Subsections with verses → Application to Communication

**TECH STACK**:
- Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React 19

**WORKFLOW**:
1. Read `AGENT-CONTINUATION-SCRIPT.md` for complete context
2. Read `app/appendix/page.tsx` to see current structure
3. Add new section before the Conclusion
4. Include 30+ KJV verses
5. Add Application to Communication subsection
6. Update Conclusion bullet list
7. Run `npm run build` to test
8. Commit and push with descriptive message

**KEY PATTERNS** (from continuation script):
- Section header: `text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 text-center` with gradient text span
- Key verse box: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[color]-50 to-[color]-50 border-l-4 border-[color]-500 p-6 mb-8 rounded`
- Verse citation: `bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg` with verse text and `text-sm text-gray-600 text-right` citation
- Application box: `bg-gradient-to-r from-amber-50 to-orange-50 rounded-xl p-8 mb-8 border-l-4 border-amber-500`

**CURRENT APPENDIX SECTIONS** (13 total):
1. Kingdom Gospel vs. Grace Gospel
2. Principles of Doctrine vs. Perfection
3. Paul's Declaration of the Grace Gospel
4. Receive Reward vs. Suffer Loss
5. Paul as Wise Masterbuilder
6. Creator God's Existence
7. Worshipping Creature More Than Creator
8. Traditions of Men vs. Word of God
9. Knowledge of God and Renewing the Mind
10. Speaking Truth: Religion, Politics, Homosexuality
11. Wheat and Tares
12. The 7,000 Who Have Not Bowed to Baal
13. Can True Christians Follow False Philosophy, Religion, and Ideas?

**NEXT STEPS**:
When I request a new section, please:
1. Read the continuation script and appendix file first
2. Add the new section using the exact same format
3. Include maximum KJV verses (30+ minimum)
4. Maintain all styling and color schemes
5. Always include Application to Communication
6. Update the Conclusion section
7. Build, test, commit, and push

Please confirm you've read the continuation script and understand the project structure before proceeding with any new work.

## Additional Notes for User

After pasting the above to your new agent, you can then request specific new sections like:
